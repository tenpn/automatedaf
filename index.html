            Automated testing involves writing code to have the game test
            itself. Most people imagine the game fully playing itself from start
            to end, which can seem daunting! However there's a spectrum of
            automation from simple asset and smoke tests to complex actor tests
            and full integration tests, and you cna do as little or as much of
            that as you like and still see value.
