          <strong>Small simple scripts</strong> to help the game test itself,
          using functionality built into both the big commercial game engines
          and easily added to custom engines.

          Run the tests when making builds (ideally on a build server - Andrew
          can also help create those from scratch), and get
          <strong>instant informative feedback</strong> when you introduce bugs.

            Bugs are found closer to the moment when they're introduced, which

            Convert smoke tests that QA have to do daily into automated tests,

            Automation helps keep the game playable, which lets you get vital
            feedback through early playtesting, and allows deep changes late
            into development.

          <h2>Less challenging than you think!</h2>
          <p>
            Automation doesn't require upending processes or making foundational
            code changes. The right strategic tests can provide value, even late
            in development.
