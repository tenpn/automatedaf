            ​I would highly recommend working with Andrew to any team who have a
            sense that they would get a lot of value from automated testing, but
            no clear idea where to start.

            In this workshop, you'll learn about the most useful test types for
            beginners:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              - <strong>​Asset tests</strong>: validating on-disk data like
              textures, meshes and game data to catch bugs before the game even
              boots
            </li>
            <li>
              - <strong>​Smoke tests</strong>: holistic tests that are simple to
              create and maintain
            </li>
            <li>
              - <strong>​Actor tests</strong>: ensuring the functionality of
              gameplay code with minimal dependencies
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ​We'll build each of those tests into an existing project that
            wasn't designed for test automation, ending the day having learned a
            whole lot <strong>and</strong> implemented some production-quality
            tests. (The example project will be Unity, but there's enough
            foundational knowledge to make this useful for any type of game
            developer)

            Through Andrew's guidance, the entire programming team became
            comfortable writing and maintaining high-quality tests, which kept
            the build stable through some scary bug fixes and optimisations late
            in development.

            Andrew is friendly and helpful to work with, good at gently steering
            us back toward best practice, but also pragmatic about giving us the
            maximum value from our time - as a small team who are also working
            on every other part of the game.
