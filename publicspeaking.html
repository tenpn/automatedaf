            A deep dive into the pragmatic approaches to test automation that
            Andrew pioneered on Rollerdrome, Roll7's award-winning rollerskating
            third-person shooter. QA were able to forgo repetitive tasks,
            artists had confidence their work would load on every platform, and
            engineers were able to continue deep optimisations very close to
            console sub.

          <h2>Automated Testing In Games Roundtables</h2>
          <p>GDC, annual, 2015 onwards</p>
          <p>
            Andrew has hosted and moderated the Automated Testing in Games
            roundtable at GDC every year since 2015, bringing together experts
            from across the industry to discuss the challenges and solutions
            around test automation in game development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The roundtables have since become a community of aspiring and
            experienced automation users that chat, share knowledge and push the
            discipline forward.

          <h2>Productive and Pragmatic Prototype Programming</h2>
          <p>GDC 2025, Develop Brighton 2025</p>
          <p>
            There's countless talks about how to run a prototype from a design
            point of view, and talks aplenty about what makes good production
            code, but when it comes to writing code for prototypes, best
            practice is either "treat it like production", or a licence to be
            slapdash and casual.
          </p>
          <p>There's more to effective prototype code than this!</p>
          <p>
            Andrew has a decade of experience leading prototyping code teams at
            Spry Fox and Roll7, and will lay out his framework for implementing
            and maintaining prototype code in a way that lets designers answer
            important questions as effectively as possible, without coders
            getting bogged down in spaghetti code.

            Andrew's first-ever test automation talk, on how he used unit
            testing to develop new AI for F1 2011, all the ways he messed it up,
            and what you can learn from that.

          <h2>The Next Vector: Improvements in AI Steering Behaviors</h2>
          <p>GDC 2013</p>
          <p>
            The public debut of the context steering system Andrew developed for
            F1 2011, which went on to become something of a standard in the
            racing genre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Context steering is an extremely useful approach when you want
            composable steering behaviours but have global constraints such as
            avoidance.

            Although a bit dated now, Andrew discusses the benefits and
            drawbacks that being a remote company brought Spry Fox and its
            employees, and how the team maintained a friendly and informal
            atmosphere when developers are on different continents.
