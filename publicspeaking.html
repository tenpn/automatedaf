            A deep dive into the pragmatic approaches to test automation that
            Andrew pioneered on Rollerdrome, Roll7's award-winning rollerskating
            third-person shooter. QA were able to forgo repetitive tasks,
            artists had confidence their work would load on every platform, and
            engineers were able to continue deep optimisations very close to
            console sub.

          <h2>Automated Testing In Games Roundtables</h2>
          <p>GDC, annual, 2015 onwards</p>
          <p>
            Andrew has hosted and moderated the Automated Testing in Games
            roundtable at GDC every year since 2015, bringing together experts
            from across the industry to discuss the challenges and solutions
            around test automation in game development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The roundtables have since become a community of aspiring and
            experienced automation users that chat, share knowledge and push the
            discipline forward.

          <p>
            There's more to effective prototype code than public statics! In
            this talk, Andrew lays out a framework for implementing and
            maintaining prototype code that lets designers answer important
            questions as effectively as possible, without coders getting bogged
            down in spaghetti code.

            Andrew's first-ever test automation talk, on how he used unit
            testing to develop new AI for F1 2011, all the ways he messed it up,
            and what you can learn from that.

            Andrew developed Context Steering for F1 2011, which went on to
            become something of a standard in the racing genre. It's extremely
            useful when you want composable behaviours but with global
            constraints.

            Although a bit dated now, Andrew discusses the benefits and
            drawbacks that being a remote company brought Spry Fox and its
            employees, and how the team maintained a friendly and informal
            atmosphere when developers are on different continents.
